<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p>Below youâ€™ll find answers to common questions you may have about Helvault. If you need extra support consider <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKDaqJOwvw5VLmsjKFGMlHS41_heSTkAIZeVWDJwuWYLIOWg/viewform?embedded=true">reaching us out</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/WMWNpmcg35">joining our Discord server</a>.</p>

<div class="faq-body">
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#new">Why there's a new Helvault app instead of just updating the old one?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="new"><br />We appreciate the support and would like to clarify the reasons behind the need for creating a new Helvault.<br />First of all, we understand how depreciative a subscription based model is to users, and that is why we do not have recurring subscriptions on the app. However, development of new features + maintenance takes time and money. We needed a way to keep new stuff coming in without forcing users to keep paying.<br /><br />The solution was to implement an 'opt-in' style where you are free to continue using what you paid for, but in case the new stuff brings enough value you can decide to upgrade to the new app. This works by keeping the 'current' (now legacy) app working just as expected, but also bringing a new one so users who see enough value can move to.<br /><br />In short, if the new app and its features bring value to you and you'd like to support the future of Helvault, welcome aboard! Otherwise you have all the means to keep using the legacy app for as long as you please.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#legacy">Will Helvault Legacy stop working?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="legacy"><br />No! The app will continue to work normally, receiving maintenance updates in case a new OS update introduces bugs. The only change is that it will no longer receive feature updates.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#newFeatures">What new features should I expect on the new app?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="newFeatures"><br />1. Added support for iCloud Sync, one of the most requested featured by the community<br />2. iPad support<br />3. Mac support<br />4. Added new filter and sorting options on the Collection section<br />5. Improved pricing support with much faster reload<br />6. Reworked the scanner so it supports offline scanning <i>(offline scanning is not yet available, will be coming soon on a future update)</i></div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#restore">Why my purchases from the Legacy app are not restored on the new app?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="restore"><br />As mentioned above, the Legacy app will continue to work normally, as is, so your purchases are and will always be yours. With that being said, by AppStore rules purchases cannot be carried over between apps. In case the new app has value to you, items will need to be purchased separately.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#missingCards">Why can't I add some cards in languages other than English?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="missingCards"><br />Helvault uses Scryfall as a provider for cards. Usually they prioritize adding cards first on the English language, meaning it may take some time until other languages such as Italian, Spanish, Japanese etc appear on Helvault.<br />As a workaround you could keep the card in English on your collection and add a <code>tag</code> to it with the language name. This way you can still keep track of the cards that are represented by the English version instead of their printed version.<br /><br />You could also <a href="https://scryfall.com/contact">reach Scryfall directly</a> to get a sense of when your cards will be added.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#prices">How are card prices calculated?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="prices"><br />Helvault uses Scryfall as a provider for cards and their prices. You can check the exact parameters for price calculation on <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/faqs/where-do-scryfall-prices-come-from-7" target="_blank">this page</a>.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#missingPrices">Some of my cards have missing prices. What can I do?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="missingPrices"><br />Card prices are calculated using the current market as a base (you can check more details <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/faqs/where-do-scryfall-prices-come-from-7" target="_blank">here</a>). If one or more cards on your collection have their price missing, and you have already attempted to reload them on the 'Stats' section, it means that currently the market does not have enough listings to have an estimated price.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#import">I'm trying to import my cards via CSV but the app is not recognizing them... Why?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="import"><br />The main way of importing cards via CSV is using the Helvault format, which contains the following columns: <code>extras</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>scryfall_id</code>, <code>quantity</code>.<br />You can also use other PRO formats such as Plain List, TCG Player, Deckbox and many others after purchasing the 'PRO Import and Export' feature.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#export">I'm trying to export my cards via CSV into another app/website but they don't recognize it... What can I do?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="export"><br />There is no unified CSV format for card import/export, so each app prefer its own... Here are some suggestions on what you can do to import cards in other services:<br /><br />1. Edit the headers of the CSV file on your computer... Maybe they expect <code>card_name</code> instead of <code>name</code>.<br />2. Reach them out asking for expected CSV formats if you don't already know.<br />3. If you need more columns on your CSV file such as <code>price</code>, <code>set code</code>, <code>set name</code>, <code>oracle id</code> etc, take a look at the 'Helvault PRO CSV' format. It's a single-purchase (not a subscription) that may help you.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#icloud">How does iCloud Sync work?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="icloud"><br />When you enable iCloud Sync by purchasing the 'iCloud Sync' feature you will leverage the power of iCloud to have all your content (such as cards, binders, lists, prices etc) synchronized between your devices.<br />Keep in mind that the larger the change the longer it takes for sync to complete. For instance, if you add a new card on device 'A' you should be seeing that card on device 'B' pretty much instantly. However if you import 1000 cards via CSV it might take a while for them to appear on all devices.</div>
    </div>
  
  
    <div class="faq-collapse-item">
      <a class="faq-collapse-btn" data-bs-toggle="collapse" href="#icloudFix">My iCloud sync isn't working. What can I do?</a>
      <div class="faq-collapse-content collapse" id="icloudFix"><br />If you have purchased the 'iCloud Sync' feature and suspect that content is not syncing properly between devices, here are some things you can do:<br /><br />1. Verify that you are signed-in with iCloud on your device. More details <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfc0f1e2a/1.0/icloud/1.0" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />2. Within the app, go to <code>Settings â†’ iCloud Syncing</code> and check that <code>iCloud Account</code> is displayed as <code>Available</code> and <code>Setup</code> displays as <code>Successful</code>. If any of these are displayed otherwise, check step <code>1</code> above.<br />3. Make sure that Helvault has permissions to use iCloud. You can do so by going to <code>Settings â†’ [your name] â†’ iCloud â†’ Show All (under the APPS USING ICLOUD section)</code>. On this page the toggle should be turned ON for Helvault. If you cannot reach this page, check step <code>1</code> above.</div>
